When finalizing files, run `cargo test` to ensure the project is in a good state.

Unit test function names should follow the form <scenario>_<expectation>.

Use `cargo test` to run unit tests and check the build.

Do not stage or commit changes with git.

Do not use assert!(x.is_err()) in unit tests. Check for the correct error with something like assert_eq!(x, Err(...));
